% This is a simple sample document.  For more complicated documents take a look in the exercise tab. Note that everything that comes after a % symbol is treated as comment and ignored when the code is compiled.

\documentclass{article} % \documentclass{} is the first command in any LaTeX code.  It is used to define what kind of document you are creating such as an article or a book, and begins the document preamble

\usepackage{amsmath} % \usepackage is a command that allows you to add functionality to your LaTeX code

\title{Simple Sample} % Sets article title
\author{My Name} % Sets authors name
\date{\today} % Sets date for date compiled

% The preamble ends with the command \begin{document}
\begin{document} % All begin commands must be paired with an end command somewhere
\maketitle % creates title using information in preamble (title, author, date)

\section{Hello World!} % creates a section

Generative AI is revolutionizing chemistry by enabling machines to design novel molecules, predict reaction outcomes, and accelerate drug discovery. Using models trained on vast chemical databases, these systems can propose compounds with desired properties, optimize synthesis pathways, and even suggest modifications to improve efficacy or reduce toxicity. By automating parts of the creative process, generative AI helps chemists explore regions of chemical space that would be prohibitively time‑consuming to investigate manually, ultimately speeding up research and opening new possibilities in materials science, pharmaceuticals, and beyond.


\textbf{Hello World!} Today I am learning \LaTeX. %notice how the command will end at the first non-alphabet charecter such as the . after \LaTeX
\LaTeX{} is a great program for writing math. I can write in line math such as $a^2+b^2=c^2$ %$ tells LaTexX to compile as math
. I can also give equations their own space:
\begin{equation} % Creates an equation environment and is compiled as math
  \gamma^2+\theta^2=\omega^2
\end{equation}
If I do not leave any blank lines \LaTeX{} will continue  this text without making it into a new paragraph.  Notice how there was no indentation in the text after equation (1).
Also notice how even though I hit enter after that sentence and here $\downarrow$
\LaTeX{} formats the sentence without any break.  Also   look  how      it   doesn't     matter          how    many  spaces     I put     between       my    words.

For a new essay I can leave a blank space in my code.
